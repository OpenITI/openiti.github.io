OpenITI has begun piloting the production of the first digital publications of Persian and Arabic works, taken straight from their original manuscript form into a digital publication without a print intermediary.

We are developing two projects in collaboration with Carl Ernst for our digital publication pipeline.

The first project is a collaboration with Carl Ernst, Mbaye Lo, and graduate students from their seminar on [ʿUmar ibn Saʿid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_ibn_Said), in which they all worked with us on encoding his writings--previously found only in manuscript form--in [OpenITI mARkdown MSS](https://openiti.github.io/mARkdownMSS/mARkdownMSS.html). An example of these texts can now be found [here](https://openiti.github.io/mARkdownMSS/1280CumarIbnSayyid/1280CumarIbnSayyid.SiraDhatiyya.LOCE445N8O43N24D4-ara1.html). All texts from this project are available [here](https://openiti.github.io/mARkdownMSS/).

The second project is another collaborative effort with Carl Ernst. In this project, we have focused on producing three scholarly editions of Indo-Persian manuscripts that Dr. Ernst had previously transcribed in plaintext format. John Mullan, digital specialist on the *OpenITI AOCP* team, worked with him on encoding them in the [OpenITI mARkdown schema](https://alraqmiyyat.github.io/mARkdown/). These texts can be found [here](https://openiti.org/oitei/).
