The textual lacunae reconstruction tool (TLR), funded by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/), will leverage new techniques for unsupervised transcription to automatically transcribe vast quantities of handwritten Arabic-script text.

OpenITI team members from the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/) and the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) will lead this project and begin to unlock the Islamicate written tradition, perhaps the largest archive of human cultural production of the premodern world. Through this work, we will train a neural encoder for images of manuscript text lines by learning to reconstruct masked regions (i.e., lacuna) of unlabeled manuscript images. Within the larger world of handwritten text recognition (HTR) research, this approach is completely unexplored. However, in other fields with similar challenges, related approaches have yielded highly promising results. 

For more information on this project, please see [this press release from the University of Maryland, College Park](https://arhu.umd.edu/news/nsf-grant-funds-research-islamicate-manuscript-transcription-methods) and [our team's recent publication on the efficacy of lacuna reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08692). 

**Funding and Project Duration:** $597,844.00 from July 2022 to June 2025 (see [subgrant one](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2200333&HistoricalAwards=false) and [subgrant two](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2200334&HistoricalAwards=false) on the National Science Foundation website for more information).
